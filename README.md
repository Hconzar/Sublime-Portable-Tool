This tool is developed to manage the context menu, file icons and file associations for Sublime Text under Windows.


Acknowledgment
==============

This project is forked from [LOO2K](https://github.com/loo2k/Sublime-Text-Portable-Tool) and several functionalities are added.

To compile this project, you need the following things.

- [Bat To Exe Converter](http://www.f2ko.de/programs.php?pid=b2e)
- [ResHacker.exe](http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker) (I use v3.6 for a smaller size.)
